So far:
1. trained an encoder-decoder CNN to identify 1 wave source, starting with clean data and then creating the robust model to handle noisy data
2. added another model for 2 wave sources
3. added sensor dropout in training to increase robustness
4. added the teacher-student method to help the model perform better on noisy data
5. implemented an FNO and used many methods to improve it

TODO:
1. update files structure (experimentation - no .py file)
2. test everything on anaconda, venv and add instructions
