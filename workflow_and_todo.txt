So far:
1. trained an encoder-decoder CNN to identify 1 wave source, starting with clean data and then creating the robust model to handle noisy data
2. added another model for 2 wave sources
3. added sensor dropout in training to increase robustness
4. added the teacher-student method to help the model perform better on noisy data
5. implemented an FNO and used many methods to improve it

TODO:
1. how to run, which environments?
2. how to should the git look like? what should it contain? (notebook?)
3. how does each model operate relative to the data (Example)
4. like 3 with epochs, #parameters
