So far:
1. trained an encoder-decoder CNN to identify 1 wave source, starting with clean data and then creating the robust model to handle noisy data
2. added another model for 2 wave sources
3. added sensor dropout in training to increase robustness
4. added the teacher-student method to help the model perform better on noisy data
5. implemented an FNO and used many methods to improve it

TODO:
1. update files structure (experimentation - no .py file)
2. test everything on anaconda, venv and add instructions

for README:

python version recommended: 3.11

Commands to install and run using venv:
1. python -m venv .venv

2. # Activate (choose based on your shell):
PowerShell: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Command Prompt: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
Git Bash/Linux/Mac: source .venv/bin/activate
OR simply (works in VS Code): .venv\Scripts\activate

3. pip install -r requirements.txt
when running the cells, if asked, choose the venv you just created (.venv)

Commands to install and run using conda:
1. conda env create -f environment.yml
2. conda activate cnn-vs-fno
when running the cells, if asked, choose the conda environemnt you just created (cnn-vs-fno)
